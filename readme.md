# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 event, written in Rust. Advent of Code is an annual December event where programmers solve one coding challenge per day leading up to Christmas.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run this project:

- Rust programming environment ([Installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

### Installing and Running

Clone the repository:

```bash
git@github.com:0OZ/advent-of-code.git
cd advent-of-code
```

To run a solution for a specific day, navigate to the day's directory and use `cargo run`:

```bash
cargo run --package day_n --bin day_n
```

## Structure

Each day's puzzle is in a separate directory:

- `day_01`
- `day_02`
- ...
- `day25`

Each directory contains:

- `src/main.rs`: Rust source file with the solution.
- `src/input.rs`: Puzzle input provided by Advent of Code.
